## **A way from total humanitarian to VBA-learner**

In 2007 I graduated law faculty of Belarussian State University. 
Long 10 year I spent _making contracts and suing debtors_, until in 2017 I decided to try something new. 
So I appeared in a large international company on the small and modest position of assistant.
As my new duties were: 
* to collect data from many associates;
* to systemize this data accurately;
* to make some analytics for management,

I started learning, at first, *MS Excel*, and then - *VBA* to automate any process that was possible to. 

## **Hello, JavaScript**

While improving some working processes once I found that Excel/VBA is already doesn't meet all my needs.
So, after several days of discovering advantages and disadvantages of different programming languages, a decided to start learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## **My achievements**

I realize that from the point of view of HR-specialist at the moment I do not have any achievents at all. 
But to my mind, at least the one great thing I've already done: I started learning!

## **Thanks for your attention! Hope to meet you in a Google office once ;)**
